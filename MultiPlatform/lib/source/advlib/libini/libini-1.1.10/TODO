Patches, bug reporting and providing help with this project would
be greatly appreciated.

The following still needs to be implemented for completeness.  

* Fix comments getting lost.

* Use list mechanism to provide access to all section/key names
  like the GetPrivateProfileString call with NULLs in the appropriate
  positions.

* Possibly track multi-layer section relationships like that used for the
  Windows registry:

  [Top]
  key1 = data

  [Top/Child]
  key1 = data

* Handle data (and possibly comments) spanning multiple lines:

; comment \
rest of comment

key1 = data \
rest of data

* Handle quotes around keys

key1 = "key1 ; This is not a comment"
